# Practicing NumPy with Sudoku
The aim of this repo is not to make yet another Sudoku solver. Reader should refer to Peter Norvig's [page](https://norvig.com/sudoku.html) to learn how to make a basic yet powerful Sudoku solver.

# This repo is also not about...
1. Making the most efficient (i.e. fastest) Sudoku solver
2. Writing the most elegant Sudoku solver
3. Extending beyond a standard Sudoku solver to generate Sudoku puzzles

# What this repo is about...
1. Getting familiar with NumPy techniques (such as data structure, broadcasting, slicing) to make a Sudoku solver with as much vectorization as possible
2. Code as many Sudoku techniques (X-Wing, Naked Pairs, etc.) as possible
